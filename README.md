Xenotool is a program for extracting models and texture files from **Xenosaga Episode I**.

This project was born in January 2018 as an exercise in reverse engineering when I was looking for the 3D models online but could not find them. Today Xenotool can read the 3D models (.lex) and textures (.xtx) from **Xenosaga Episode I** (with varying levels of success) and then export the models as glTF binary and the textures as PNGs. It also supports uncompressing the ARX files the game uses.
